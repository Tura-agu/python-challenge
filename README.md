 PyBank
 Tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial 
 records of a company. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

Pypoll

Tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 
Given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv], I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
